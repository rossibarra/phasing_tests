# Infer mom's genotype by JRI

We have obs. mom and obs. (selfed) kids.  We want to know $P(G|\theta)$, and $P(G|\theta) \propto P(\theta|G) \times P(G)$, 
where $\theta$ is observed data.  This consists of observed genotypes ($G'$) of both mom and kids. So:
$P(G|\theta)\propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}{P(G'_k|G)} \right) \times P(G'_{mom}|G) \times P(G)$
This function is to impute mom's genotype from a progeny array of k kids at a single locus.
inferred_mom=1 -> 00, 2->01, 3->11


----------
- H: heterozygote sites of a given window size (10, 20) and stepping size 1 SNP.

$P(H|\theta) \propto P(\theta|H) \times P(H)$   
$P(H|\theta) \propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}{P(H'_k|H)} \right) \times P(H'_{mom}|H) \times P(H)$

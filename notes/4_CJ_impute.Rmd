# Infer mom's genotype by JRI

We have obs. mom and obs. (selfed) kids.  We want to know $P(G|\theta)$, and $P(G|\theta) \propto P(\theta|G) \times P(G)$, 
where $\theta$ is observed data.  This consists of observed genotypes ($G'$) of both mom and kids. So:
$P(G|\theta)\propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}{P(G'_k|G)} \right) \times P(G'_{mom}|G) \times P(G)$
This function is to impute mom's genotype from a progeny array of k kids at a single locus.
inferred_mom=1 -> 00, 2->01, 3->11

# Imputing Founder Genotypes  
$P(G|\theta) \propto P(\theta|G) \times P(G)$   
$$P(G|\theta)\propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}{P(G'_i|G)} \right) \times \left( \sum_{n=1}^{mom} P(G'_{mom}|G) \right) \times P(G)$$  

----------

This function is to impute mom's genotype by finding the maximum likelihood of $P(G|\theta)$ from a progeny array of k kids at a single locus.
- Where $\theta$ denotes observed data. It consists of observed genotypes ($G'$) of both mom and kids.  
- $P(G)$ is the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium estimated from the population.  
- $P(G'_{mom}|G)$ is the error matrix estimated from the data, i.e. homozygote error = 0.02 and heterozygote error =0.6.  
- $P(G'_i|G)$ is the error matrix times Mendelian segregation rate.

# Phasing Founder Genotypes  
$P(H|\theta) \propto P(\theta|H) \times P(H)$   
$P(H|\theta) \propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}{P(H'_k|H)} \right) \times P(H)$  
$P(H|\theta) \propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}\prod\limits_{l=1}^{n}{P(G'_{i,l}|H)} \right) \times P(H)$

- Where $\theta$ denotes observed data.
- $P(H)$ is the probability of the haplotype for a given window size of $n$.
- $P(G'_{i,l}|H)$ is the probability of kid $i$ at locus $l$ for a given haplotype $H$.
- We assume all the possible haplotypes of a given window size are equally likely.

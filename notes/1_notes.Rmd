# Infer mom's genotype by JRI

We have obs. mom and obs. (selfed) kids.  We want to know $P(G|\theta)$, and $P(G|\theta) \propto P(\theta|G) \times (G)$, 
where $\theta$ is observed data.  This consists of observed genotypes ($G'$) of both mom and kids. So:
$P(G|\theta)\propto \left( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}{P(G'_k|G)} \right) \times P(G'_{mom}|G) \times P(G)$
This function is to impute mom's genotype from a progeny array of k kids at a single locus.
inferred_mom=1 -> 00, 2->01, 3->11

# Current issues
1. ~~errors should not be used for inferring~~   
2. ~~p unknown, could only be estimated from data.~~

3. haplotype needs to consider imputation error.?
4. lost info (i.e. sites heter but inferred homo)?
5. missing data?
6. mom + dad
7. File IO

# To Do List:
1. ~~impute Mom~~
2. phase Mom
3. phase Kids
4. impute Kids
